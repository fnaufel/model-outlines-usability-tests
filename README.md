Description of usability test of model outlines
===============================================

Introduction
------------

This page describes the material designed for the usability tests of the
*model outline* visual notation for ALCN concept descriptions.

Model outlines are presented and explained in detail in the paper\

> Fernando NÃ¡ufel do Amaral\
> Model Outlines: a Visual Language for DL Concept Descriptions\
> *Semantic Web Journal*, 2012\
> URL:

and in other papers referenced there.

Main goal
---------

Show that model outlines can help users with little or no training in
Logic to understand complex concept descriptions. In particular, model
outlines are more effective than Manchester OWL for this task.

Activities
----------

One session of the study consisted of the activities in the list below,
which also contains links to files containing the material used (in
Brazilian Portuguese).

-   information to the participant ([pdf,
    92KB](10informacaoParticipante.pdf))
-   term of informed consent ([pdf, 84KB](20consentimento.pdf))
-   a pre-test questionnaire ([pdf, 109KB](30preTest.pdf))
-   a tutorial on notation A using the pizza domain:
    -   A = Manchester OWL ([pdf,
        150KB](40tutorialManchester.pdf))
    -   A = model outlines ([pdf, 739KB](40tutorialMOPizzas.pdf))
-   a specification about domain X using notation A:
    -   X = graduate courses, A = Manchester OWL ([pdf,
        29KB](50specsManchesterCursos.pdf))
    -   X = graduate courses, A = model outlines ([pdf,
        570KB](50specsOutlinesCursos.pdf))
    -   X = family relations, A = Manchester OWL ([pdf,
        27KB](50specsManchesterFamilia.pdf))
    -   X = family relations, A = model outlines ([pdf,
        545KB](50specsOutlinesFamilia.pdf))
-   15 questions about the specification on domain X, followed by a
    post-task questionnaire
    -   X = graduate courses ([pdf, 141KB](60tasksCursos.pdf))
    -   X = family relations ([pdf, 133KB](60tasksFamilia.pdf))
-   a tutorial on notation B using the pizza domain
-   a specification about domain Y using notation B
-   15 questions about the specification on domain Y, followed by a
    post-task questionnaire
-   a post-test questionnaire ([pdf, 107KB](70posTeste.pdf))
